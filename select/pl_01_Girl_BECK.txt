I saw her yeah I saw her
With a black tongue tied
around the roses
Fists pounding on a
vending machine
Torrid diamond ring
stuck on her finger
With a noose she could
hang from the sun
Pointed out with the
dark sunglasses
Walking quickly
down the beach
She spits on the sand where the
bums are beaching
And I know
I'm gonna steal a life
She doesn't even
know it's wrong
And you know I'm gonna
make it right
Take her where her
soul belongs
Know I'm gonna steal a life
Nothing that I wouldn't try
My summer girl
Hey my summer girl
My summer girl
Hey my summer girl
I saw her yeah I saw her
With her hands tied back
a black Suburban
Calling out from a
landfilled life
Scrawling her name
up on the ceiling
Throw a coin in the
fountain of dust
White noise
her ears are ringing
Got a ticket for my
midnight hanging
Throw a from a freight
train leaving
And I know
I'm gonna steal a life
She doesn't even
know it's wrong
And you know
I'm gonna make it right
Take her where her soul belongs
Know I'm gonna steal a life
Nothing that I wouldn't try
My summer girl
Hey my summer girl
My summer girl
Hey my summer girl

Hey my summer girl
Hey my summer girl
My summer girl
Hey my summer girl
Hey my summer girl
Hey my summer girl
My summer girl
Hey my summer girl
